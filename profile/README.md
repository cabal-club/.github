## ABOUT cabal

No servers are needed to join a cabal, or to start your own. Everything is stored and runs locally. A cabal can never go down or be taken away.

A cabal is identified by its secret key (`cabal://7d99b453506b974...`) that you share with your friends. This key lets them find and join the cabal.

Cabal works over the internet, but also works offline: you can still browse your full chat history, and send messages that will be sync'd with any future peers you connect to.
